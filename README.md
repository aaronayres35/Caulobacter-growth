(Note: in the analysis of 6.2 onwards we transitioned from using our own analysis data from problem 5.1 due to it having a large amount of noise.  We then utilized the data from the solution key obtained from the same original data set but with a different image processing pipeline.  This file is contained in the data/ folder of the repository. - This was discussed with Professor Bois directly)
